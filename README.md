# Cub3D
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore **ray-casting**. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

## **The Original Game 🎮**

[Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) is the first true "First Person Shooter" in the history of video games 🙌

It is the ancestor of games like [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), [Doom II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_II), [Duke Nukem 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D) and [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)).

You can play it [here](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/).
